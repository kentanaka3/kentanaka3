### 🎓 Education & Recognition

**PhD in Applied Data Science and Artificial Intelligence**
*Jan. 2023 - Present · [University of Trieste (UniTs)](https://adsai.inginf.units.it/)*
- Implemented distributed training and inference pipelines across multi-node GPU clusters, leveraging parallel computing techniques (MPI, CUDA) to handle large-scale seismic datasets efficiently.
- Engineered a custom validation framework using bipartite optimization and weighted similarity scores to ensure high-fidelity event matching and maintain strict accuracy against official reference catalogs.

**Master in High Performance Computing**
*Sep. 2023 - Aug. 2024 · [International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA)](https://www.mhpc.it)*
- Developed an end-to-end ML pipeline for automated, real-time earthquake detection, enabling regional monitoring systems to instantly process and characterize seismic events at scale.
- Architected HPC-optimized workflows using deep learning models (Transformers and CNNs) to ingest massive, continuous data streams, drastically increasing processing speed compared to legacy CPU systems.

**Postgraduate Diploma in Quantitative Life Science**
*Sep. 2022 - Aug. 2023 · [International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)](https://www.ictp.it/opportunity/ictp-postgraduate-diploma-programme)*

**BSc. Physics**
*Aug. 2016 - Dec. 2021 · [University of Guadalajara](https://www.cucei.udg.mx/carreras/fisica/)*
- Simulated complex social systems using 1D Ising spin models to analyze the dynamics of racial segregation and social pressure. By integrating local and global exchange dynamics (Kawasaki and Schelling models), I identified how environmental "noise" and "temperature" impact system stability, equilibrium, and the transition from order to chaos.
- Quantified system behaviors through rigorous statistical analysis, extracting critical power-law exponents ($z \approx 2.48$, $\lambda \approx 1.15$, $\theta \approx 0.46$) to define domain growth and persistence. I optimized the computational simulations to resolve numerical difficulties in ground-state transitions, moving the project from theoretical abstracts to high-fidelity numerical results.
